Hi there!

This is a **Daily Self Check-In App** designed to help you stay centered, motivated, and mentally clear — in just a few minutes a day.

✨ Why Use It?

* Reflect daily on what excites or drains you
* Build a "growth mindset" while staying emotionally grounded
* Receive gentle, thoughtful feedback from an AI coach — personalized to what you wrote

🤖 What Makes It Different?

Unlike journaling or even most coaching tools:

* It gives you immediate, private AI-generated score and coaching suggestions also keeping in mind your past check-ins
* Think of it as having a **super coach** who reads between the lines and nudges you forward — one step forward each time
